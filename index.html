        <p><em>Accounts Manager, Receptionist, Sales Lady</em></p>
        <p><em>Wildlife, Art, Gaming and Fishkeeping Enthusiast</em></p>
        <p>I was born in the small town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhanda,_Eastern_Cape">Grahamstown</a>, situated in the Eastern Cape,
          South Africa. I grew up with a major passion for Wildlife and I was always
          creative with everything I did, thus the love for Art. I later became
          obsessed with Gaming and play games in my spare time or relax. I have now
          also started Fishkeeping and breeding Angelfish, which I hope to sell to
          local pet stores. I have experience in Accounts Management, in particular Medical Aid Claims.
          I also know how to carry out receptionist duties in a professional manner.
          And I have knowledge in sales of products.
          I hope to succeed in my new career as Web Developer
          and start my own online business as a freelance Web Developer.</p>
